This update adds two new major sections to the CONTEXT.md file:


1. Database Schema - Detailed MongoDB collections with their fields, types, and relationships
2. Project Structure - A comprehensive folder structure for both frontend and backend


The schema is designed to support all the features mentioned in the original document, with proper relationships between collections. The folder structure follows best practices for MERN stack applications, with clear separation of concerns and modular organization.


The database schema includes all necessary collections for:
- User management
- Student profiles
- Company information
- Job postings
- Applications
- Notifications


The project structure is organized to support:
- Clean code architecture
- Separation of concerns
- Reusable components
- Easy maintenance
- Scalability


These additions provide a solid foundation for implementing the placement dashboard system.




## Conclusion


The Placement Dashboard streamlines placement activities through automation and efficient process management. It provides a comprehensive solution for managing the entire placement lifecycle, benefiting students, recruiters, and placement officers while improving overall placement outcomes.
